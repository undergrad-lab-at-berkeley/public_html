<h2>Mission</h2>

The Undergraduate Labs at Berkeley are founded on the principle that undergraduate research should be accessible to all students. In particular, we recognize that there are significant barriers to entry for students traditionally underrepresented in academia. Our student-led research training organization helps student pursue research through a series of skills-building workshops combined with hands-on experience. For more information, please visit our <a href="https://ulab.berkeley.edu/labs/physics">main site.</a>

<br><br>

While space in our program is often limited, ULAB has a number of curriculum resources on topics such as Python, LaTeX, statistics, etc. that will appeal to a wide range of audiences---from beginners to the more experienced. <element style="color:#736AFF">Thus, we hope that this website will serve as a useful reference for all undergraduates to learn and sharpen their research skills!</element>

<br><br>

The lectures, exercises, and guides posted on this site were created by the many members of the ULAB curriculum development team as well as our collaborators at the <a href="https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/eps_eguide">Engineering and Physical Sicences Libraries</a> at Berkeley and the <a href="https://sps.berkeley.edu/">Society of Physics Students</a>. Thank you to everyone that has contributed!
